There are several ways to obtain RPMs

#### Use Yum --downloadonly option
# This will only download the packages needed for  your server's current state
yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/repo_files/package <packages>

#### Use repotrack --- gets MANY dependencies
# This will download ll packages required.
# It has a bug causing it to download i686 in addition to x86_64 packages.
# To get around this issue, you can just delete them after as we do below.
# Also see repoquery
repotrack -a x86_64 -p /repo_files/package <packages>

ls /repo_files/package/* |egrep '\.i686\.rpm$' |xargs -i rm {}

## Note - yumrdownloader --resolve does not seem to get all of the dependencies


#### RHEL7 requirement: libtirpc-devel
# Ambari will fail to deploy due to a yum dependency error on RHEL 7
# Obtain the missing rpm as follows:

# enable the repo
yum-config-manager --enable rhui-REGION-rhel-server-optional
# get the rpms for installing "offline"
yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/repo_files/package libtirpc-devel
